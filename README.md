# JavaScript Objects 

This repository contains a basic example of JavaScript objects, showcasing how to define and use object properties and methods.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Defines two objects (`person1` and `person2`).
- Each object contains personal details like `Firstname`, `Lastname`, `age`, and `isEmployed`.
- Both objects have their own methods (`going` and `eat`) that print messages to the console.
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.

## ðŸ¤” Why Use Objects?
Objects in JavaScript allow us to group related data and behavior together, making code more organized and easier to manage. Here are some key benefits:
- **Encapsulation**: Objects bundle properties and methods together, reducing redundancy.
- **Reusability**: Objects can be reused and extended to create more complex structures.
- **Better Data Management**: Storing related data in an object improves readability and maintainability.
- **Scalability**: Objects enable structured data handling, making applications easier to scale.
